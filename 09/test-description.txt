1. test1.txt:

   test1 tests __eq__ from class Vertex.

   For cows:
            same name  +      same position   =>      same cow
            same name  + different positions  => different cows
       different names +      same position   => different cows
   For paintballs:
            same name  +      same radius     +     same position         =>      same paintball
            one of the above (name, radius, or position) are diifferent   => different paintballs
   Note that different paintballs with the same name will not be counted as the same color.

2. test2.txt
  
   The best result is the most number of times all cows being painted despite the colors
   In test2:
   Although triggering GREEN paintball will not trigger any other paintballs, the GREEN paintball will paint 4 cows and 1 time for each cow.
   Although triggering any one of the three other paintballs will trigger the other two paintballs, they will only paint 1 cow for 3 times.
   Therefore, the best choice is to trigger the GREEN paintball.


3. test3.txt
   
   In test3, a tie occurs when choosing the optimal result => triggering PURPLE or BROWN are both the best choice with 3 total paint on cows.
   The program will always show the same result unless we change the hash function of dictionary, which will change the order of traversing.
